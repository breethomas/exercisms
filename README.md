**About exercism.io**

The *goal* of exercism is to think deeply about simple, expressive,
readable code.

The *purpose* of exercism is to:
practice writing expressive code.
practice accepting feedback graciously.
practice giving feedback respectfully.

**The art of the nitpick**:
When reviewing exercism submissions, it is possible and encouraged to
share advice and insight on the style and approach of a given
implementation.
Nitpicks should provide positive and constructive criticism, subtly
nudging a coder toward progressively better implementations of an
exercise.
Consider it an opportunity to explore the subtleties of a particular
coding problem.
Instead of outright suggesting an altogether different implementation,
consider instead giving suggestions of small adjustments or refactorings
to evolve the design and style of the existing code toward a more ideal
implementation, by some definition of ideal.
In most cases, our idea of ideal code is simple, readable, maintainable,
and modular.
Consider it an opportunity to discuss different coding practices and the
value they provide in the context of crafting better software.
Please note that good job or great work are not positive, constructive
feedback. If there is something you like about a solution, be specific
when describing it.
When leaving nitpicks, please remember that beginners do not always have
the same confidence level as more experienced developers. It is
therefore important to be courteous and considerate. Strive to be clear
in your explanations and give users a chance to arrive at their own
improvements. Might the Socratic Method be a suitable approach?
